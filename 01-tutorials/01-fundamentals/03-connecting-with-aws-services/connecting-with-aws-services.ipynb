    "# Connecting Strands Agents with AWS services\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this example we will guide you through how to connect your Strands Agents to AWS services. We will create an agent that connects to an [Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/) and an [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to handle reservation tasks in a restaurant assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strands Agents also provides the out-of-the-box tool of [`use_aws`](https://github.com/strands-agents/tools/blob/main/src/strands_tools/use_aws.py) to allow you to interact with any AWS service that has boto3 support. The tool handles authentication, parameter validation, response formatting, and provides user-friendly error messages with input schema recommendations. You can experiment with it for your agentic applications.\n",
