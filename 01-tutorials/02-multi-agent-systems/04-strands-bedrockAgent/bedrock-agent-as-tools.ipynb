    "# Bedrock Agents as Tools with Strands Agents\n",
    "Strands agents and Amazon Bedrock agents can seamlessly collaborate within a multi-agent system. By wrapping an existing Bedrock agent as a tool, a new Strands agent can invoke and interact with the Bedrock agent—enabling powerful workflows without needing to rewrite or modify the original Bedrock agent. This approach allows you to combine the strengths of both platforms, orchestrating tasks and sharing information between agents through well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll learn how to invoke an Amazon Bedrock agent from a Strands agent by wrapping the Bedrock agent as a tool. This approach enables seamless integration of external AI services into your multi-agent workflows using the \"agents as tools\" pattern."
