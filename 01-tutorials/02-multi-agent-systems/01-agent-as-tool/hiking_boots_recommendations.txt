HIKING BOOTS RECOMMENDATIONS

I'd be happy to help you find the right hiking boots! To give you the best recommendations, could you tell me more about:

YOUR HIKING STYLE:
- Day hikes, backpacking, or casual trails?
- What terrain (rocky, muddy, desert, etc.)?

YOUR PREFERENCES:
- Budget range?
- Foot width (narrow, regular, wide)?
- Any specific features needed (waterproof, lightweight, ankle support)?

GENERAL CATEGORIES TO CONSIDER:

DAY HIKING BOOTS:
- Merrell Moab 3 - versatile, comfortable for most terrains
- Salomon X Ultra 3 GTX - great traction, waterproof

BACKPACKING BOOTS:
- Lowa Renegade GTX - excellent support, durable
- Scarpa Zodiac Plus GTX - mountaineering-grade construction

LIGHTWEIGHT OPTIONS:
- Altra Lone Peak - zero-drop, wide toe box
- Hoka Speedgoat - maximum cushioning

KEY FEATURES TO LOOK FOR:
- Proper fit with room for toe movement
- Adequate ankle support for your needs
- Waterproofing (GTX/eVent) if hiking in wet conditions
- Vibram or similar quality outsoles for traction

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or narrow down based on your specific needs?

*Note: I recommend trying boots on in-store when possible, as fit varies significantly between brands and foot shapes.*
